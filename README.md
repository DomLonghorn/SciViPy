The York Science Team going rogue using git

These files are part of our Internship tasks of converting MAST-U data into visualised and available
data points to be used in VR spaces. The scripts in use are described below:

JOREK_VIS_SCRIPT:
    Visualises the JOREK MAST data set provided for us by the UKAEA and outputs the updated vtk files
Timestep_Calculator:
    Takes a .txt file containing the timesteps for a given file (in this instance the JOREK data) and outputs a list of equitemporal timesteps for a chosen number of points
BOUT++ Scripts are still heavily WIP and are dependant on people from within the UKAEA to create interpolaition so data can be understood and outputted
