The York Science Team going rogue using git

These files are part of our Internship tasks of converting MAST-U data into visualised and available
data points to be used in VR spaces.

The main codes are the NETCDF file converter which converts a native BOUT++ output file to VTK which
paraview can natively read. As well as this, our Time Reader allows us to easily create equitemporal
data points from text files with time sections as needed.
The others are either test beds or debugging codes
